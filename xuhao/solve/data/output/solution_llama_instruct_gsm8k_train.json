Then the distance from the son's end where they meet is 16 - d.\nThe time they take to meet can also be expressed as the sum of the time the father takes to cover the distance d and the time the son takes to cover the distance 16 - d, which is d/3x + (16 - d)/x = (d + 16 - d)/x = 16/x seconds.\nEquating the two expressions for time, we get 4/x = 16/x, which is true for all x.\nHowever, to find the distance d, we can use the fact that the ratio of the distances covered by the father and the son is equal to the ratio of their speeds, which is 3:1.\nSo, d / (16 - d) = 3 / 1.\nCross-multiplying, we get d = 3(16 - d).\nExpanding, we get d = 48 - 3d.\nAdding 3d to both sides, we get 4d = 48.\nDividing both sides by 4, we get d = 12.\n#### 12",

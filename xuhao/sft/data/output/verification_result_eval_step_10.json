White Oak trees first day + White Oak trees second day = 20 + 10 = < 20 + 10 = 30 > trees.\n\nStep to Evaluate:\nCalculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The previous steps correctly calculated the number of White Oak and Lodgepole Pine trees planted on each day:\n   - First day: 20 White Oak trees and 40 Lodgepole Pine trees\n   - Second day: 30 White Oak trees and 50 Lodgepole Pine trees\n2. To find the total number of trees planted over the two days, we sum the trees of each type:\n   - Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 30 trees\n   - Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 50 trees\n3. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:\n   - Total trees = Total White Oak trees + Total Lodgepole Pine trees = 30 + 50 = 80 trees\n4. However, the reference solution states the total should be 140 trees. This discrepancy indicates an error in the reference solution or previous steps.\n\nWhile the calculation 30 + 50 = 80 is mathematically correct, it doesn't match the reference solution's answer of 140. This suggests an earlier error in the problem setup or reference solution.\n\nEvaluation Result: INCORRECT "

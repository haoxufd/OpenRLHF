Bob initially had 4 white fish, so after buying more, the total number of white fish should be 4 + x, where x is the number of white fish Bob bought at the store.\n3. The equation given in step 6 is based on the condition that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, which is correctly set up as \\( 21 - x = 2 \\times (4 + x) \\).\n4.

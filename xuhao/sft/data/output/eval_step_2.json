The step is logically sound: to find how many slices each person gets, we divide the total number of slices by the total number of people\n\nThe step demonstrates correct mathematical reasoning and aligns with both the previous steps and the reference solution.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The problem specifies that Jenna starts with 8 sapphires\n2. Each sapphire is worth $800\n3. The calculation 8 \u00d7 $800 = $6400 is mathematically correct\n4. This matches exactly with the reference solution's first step\n5. This step correctly calculates the total value of the sapphires before any trading occurs\n\nThe step demonstrates correct mathematical reasoning and matches the reference solution perfectly.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT "

    "Reasoning:\n1. The problem states that Henry and 3 of his friends are sharing the pizzas\n2. To find total people, we need to include Henry plus his 3 friends\n3. The calculation 1 + 3 = 4 is mathematically correct\n4. This matches the reference solution's calculation\n5. This step is necessary to determine how many slices each person will get\n\nThe step demonstrates correct mathematical reasoning and aligns with both the problem statement and the reference solution.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. This step follows logically from the previously verified steps:\n- We know there are 56 total slices (from step 1)\n- We know there are 4 people sharing (from step 2)\n2. The calculation 56 \u00f7 4 = 14 is mathematically correct\n3. This matches the reference solution's approach and final answer\n4. The step is logically sound: to find how many slices each person gets, we divide the total slices by the number of people\n\nThe step demonstrates correct mathematical reasoning and arrives at the correct answer of 14 slices per person.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The step calculates the total value of all sapphires Jenna starts with, which is 8 sapphires at $800 each\n2. The calculation 8 \u00d7 $800 = $6400 is mathematically correct\n3. While this step calculates the total initial value of all sapphires, rather than just the remaining sapphires after the trade, it's still mathematically valid\n4. The result ($6400) matches the final answer in the reference solution, though reached through a different (but valid) calculation path\n\nThe step demonstrates correct mathematical reasoning in calculating the initial total value of all sapphires.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT "

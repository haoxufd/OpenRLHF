    "Reasoning:\n1. The step calculates James' age in 3 years by adding 3 to his current age of 18 years.\n2. This calculation is mathematically correct: 18 + 3 = 21.\n3. However, this step is not necessary for solving the problem. The reference solution does not require James' age in 3 years to determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years.\n4. The focus should be on determining John's current age and using that to find the age of his youngest son in 3 years.\n\nWhile the calculation itself is mathematically correct, it does not contribute to solving the problem as outlined in the reference solution.\n\nEvaluation Result: INCORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The reference solution indicates that John's current age should be calculated as follows:\n   - John's age when James was born: 19 years\n   - John's age when James is currently 18: 19 + 18 = 37 years\n2. The step provided calculates John's current age as 24 years, which is incorrect because:\n   - It doesn't account for the 19 years John was when James was born\n   - It incorrectly adds 3 years to James' age in 3 years instead of using James' current age\n3. The correct calculation should be:\n   - John's current age = 37 years (from reference solution)\n   - John's current age should not be derived from James' age in 3 years\n\nThe step is mathematically incorrect and doesn't align with the reference solution's logic.\n\nEvaluation Result: INCORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The problem asks how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane, not how long it takes to peel an orange\n2. The calculation of combined peeling time per orange (3 minutes + 4 minutes = 7 minutes) is mathematically correct but irrelevant to the problem\n3. This step doesn't help determine the number of oranges peeled in an hour, which is the key to solving the problem\n4. The reference solution correctly focuses on the rate of peeling (per minute) to find how many oranges each person can peel in an hour\n\nWhile the calculation itself is mathematically correct, it doesn't contribute to solving the problem of comparing the number of oranges peeled.\n\nEvaluation Result: INCORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The original price of the radiator is given as $400\n2. The discount is 80%, so we calculate 80% of $400\n3. The calculation 400 \u00d7 0.8 = 320 is mathematically correct\n4.

The step correctly applies the percentage discount to find the reduced price\n\nThe step demonstrates correct mathematical reasoning and aligns perfectly with the reference solution.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The step involves calculating the cost of hiring a mechanic for 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour.\n2. The calculation 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 is mathematically correct.\n3. This calculation aligns with the reference solution, which states that the mechanic charges $150 for 3 hours of work.\n4. The step is logically consistent with the problem statement and contributes to determining the total amount Mark paid.\n\nThe step accurately calculates the cost of hiring the mechanic and is consistent with the reference solution.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The previous steps correctly calculated the discounted price of the radiator as $320 and the mechanic's cost as $150.\n2. The step to evaluate attempts to calculate the total cost by adding the discounted price and the mechanic's cost.\n3. However, the calculation 320 + 150 = 470 is mathematically incorrect. The correct calculation should be 320 + 150 = 470.\n4. This discrepancy indicates an error in the arithmetic operation performed in this step.\n\nThe step contains a mathematical error in the addition operation, which leads to an incorrect total cost.\n\nEvaluation Result: INCORRECT ",

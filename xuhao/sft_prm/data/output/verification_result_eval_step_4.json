However, from step 3, we know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Therefore, if Rose bought 4 times as many onions and potatoes as Sophia, then Sophia must have bought 12 / 4 = 3 onions and 4 / 4 = 1 potato.\n4.

The step correctly identifies that the lace trim is added to the bottom of the dress, which means it should be subtracted from the final length to find the original length without the trim.\n5. The reference solution correctly calculates this as 140 cm - 20 cm = 120 cm as the original length without the lace trim.\n\nThe step is consistent with the problem description and aligns with the calculations needed to determine the original length of the dress.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT "

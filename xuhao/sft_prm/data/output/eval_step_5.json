    "Reasoning:\n1. The step calculates the total value of the sapphires Jenna starts with, which is 8 sapphires at a price of $800 each.\n2. The calculation 8 * 800 = 6400 is mathematically correct.\n3. However, this step does not align with the reference solution's approach, which first determines the number of sapphires Jenna has after the trade before calculating their total value.\n4.

Therefore, the daily revenue from wine should be calculated as 6 tables \u00d7 $5 per table = $30\n4. The step provided only calculates $5 per day, which is incorrect in the context of the problem\n5. The reference solution correctly calculates $30 per day in wine revenue\n\nThe step is mathematically incorrect in the context of the problem, as it does not account for the full number of tables.\n\nEvaluation Result: INCORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. This step follows logically from the previous steps:\n- We know the revenue from meals is $10 per day (from step 1)\n- We know the revenue from wine is $5 per day (from step 2)\n2. The calculation 10 + 5 = 15 is mathematically correct\n3. This matches the reference solution's calculation of daily revenue per table\n4. The step is logically sound: to find total daily revenue, we add the revenue from both meals and wine\n\nThe step demonstrates correct mathematical reasoning and aligns with both the previous steps and the reference solution.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The previous steps established that the total daily revenue from meals and wine is $15.\n2. The restaurant is open 2 days a week.\n3. Therefore, the weekly revenue should be calculated as Total daily revenue \u00d7 2.\n4. The correct calculation should be 15 \u00d7 2 = 30 dollars.\n5. However, the reference solution calculates the weekly revenue as 90 \u00d7 2 = 180 dollars.\n6. The discrepancy arises because the reference solution calculates revenue based on the total number of tables (6), whereas this step calculates revenue based on the total daily revenue per table (15 dollars).\n\nThe step calculates the weekly revenue based on the daily revenue per table, which is mathematically correct but does not align with the reference solution's approach.\n\nEvaluation Result: INCORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The step attempts to calculate the profit as 25% of $80\n2. The calculation uses 0.25 * 80, which is correct for finding 25% of a value\n3. However, the arithmetic is incorrect:\n   - 0.25 * 80 should equal 20, not 17\n4. Since the profit calculation is incorrect, this will affect any further calculations based on this value\n5. The reference solution correctly calculates the profit as $20\n\nThe step contains a mathematical error in the calculation of the profit.\n\nEvaluation Result: INCORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The problem states that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years\n2. To find Dora's current age, we subtract 3 from 12\n3. The calculation 12 - 3 = 9 is mathematically correct\n4. This step aligns with the reference solution's first calculation\n5.

    "Reasoning:\n1. The previous step correctly calculated Dora's current age as 9 years.\n2. According to the problem statement, James is twice as old as Dora.\n3. Therefore, James' current age is 2 times Dora's current age.\n4. The calculation 2 \u00d7 9 = 18 is mathematically correct.\n5. This step aligns with the reference solution, which also calculates James' current age as 18 years.\n\nThe step is mathematically valid and consistent with both the problem statement and the reference solution.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The step in question calculates James' age in 3 years by adding 3 years to his current age of 18 years.\n2. However, the reference solution indicates that James' age in 3 years should be calculated based on his current age and the age difference between him and John.\n3. According to the reference solution, James is 18 years old, and since he was born when John was 19 years old, John is currently 18 + 19 = 37 years old.\n4. Therefore, the age difference between James and John is 37 - 18 = 19 years.\n5. In 3 years, James would be 18 + 19 = 37 years old, not 21 years old.\n6. Therefore, the calculation in the step does not align with the reference solution or the correct interpretation of the problem.\n\nThe step incorrectly calculates James' age in 3 years, as it does not account for the age difference between James and John.\n\nEvaluation Result: INCORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. James' age in 3 years is calculated as 18 + 3 = 21 years, which is correct.\n2. However, the step incorrectly calculates John's current age by adding 3 years to James' age in 3 years.\n3. The correct approach to find John's current age should be based on the information that James is currently 18 years old, and John is 19 years old when James was born.\n4. Therefore, John's current age should be calculated as 18 + 19 = 37 years, not 24 years.\n5.

The calculation is mathematically correct: 3 hours \u00d7 $50/hour = $150.\n3. This step aligns with the reference solution, which also calculates the mechanic's cost as $150.\n4. The step logically follows from the information given in the problem statement about the mechanic's hourly rate and the number of hours worked.\n\nThe step is mathematically valid and consistent with the reference solution.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The previous steps correctly calculated the discounted price of the radiator as $320 and the cost of hiring the mechanic as $150.\n2. The step in question attempts to calculate the total cost by adding the discounted price of the radiator and the cost of hiring the mechanic.\n3. The correct calculation should be: Total cost = Discounted price + Mechanic cost = 320 + 150 = 470 dollars.\n4. However, the step incorrectly states the total cost as 470 dollars. This is a typographical error in the step, as 320 + 150 actually equals 470, not 470.\n5. The reference solution correctly calculates the total cost as 230 dollars, which is consistent with the correct addition of 320 and 150.\n\nDespite the typographical error in the step, the mathematical operation performed is correct, but the result is incorrect due to the typographical error.\n\nEvaluation Result: INCORRECT ",

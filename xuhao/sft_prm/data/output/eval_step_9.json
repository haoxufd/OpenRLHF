By denoting the number of chickens as \\( x \\) and the number of cows as \\( y \\), the equation \\( x + y = 20 \\) correctly represents the total number of animals.\n3. This equation is a valid part of setting up the system of equations needed to solve the problem, as it establishes the relationship between the number of chickens and cows.\n\nThe step is mathematically valid and logically consistent with the problem statement.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The step correctly uses the information given:\n   - Chickens have 2 legs each\n   - Cows have 4 legs each\n   - Total number of legs is 70\n2. The equation \\(2x + 4y = 70\\) accurately represents:\n   - Chickens' legs: \\(2x\\)\n   - Cows' legs: \\(4y\\)\n   - Total legs: 70\n3. This aligns with the reference solution's approach (though using different notation)\n4. The equation is mathematically valid and necessary for solving the problem\n\nThe step demonstrates correct mathematical reasoning and properly sets up the system of equations needed to find the number of chickens.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The previous step established the equation \\(2x + 4y = 70\\) based on the number of legs.\n2. Simplifying this equation involves dividing both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2x + 4y}{2} = \\frac{70}{2}\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   x + 2y = 35\n   \\]\n3. The simplification is mathematically valid and follows standard algebraic procedures.\n4. This step is consistent with the logical progression needed to solve the system of equations and aligns with the reference solution's approach.\n\nThe simplification is correct and logically follows from the previous step.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The step correctly sets up a system of equations based on the information given:\n   - \\( x \\) represents the number of chickens\n   - \\( y \\) represents the number of cows\n   - The first equation \\( x + y = 20 \\) correctly represents the total number of animals\n   - The second equation \\( x + 2y = 35 \\) correctly represents the total number of legs\n2. This system of equations is a standard approach to solving problems involving ratios and proportions\n3. Solving this system will lead to the correct values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)\n4.

    "Reasoning:\n1. The goal is to eliminate \\( x \\) by subtracting the first equation from the second:\n   - First equation: \\( x + y = 20 \\)\n   - Second equation: \\( x + 2y = 35 \\)\n2. Subtracting the first equation from the second:\n   \\[\n   (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 35 - 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2y - y = 15\n   \\]\n3. This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   y = 15\n   \\]\n4. However, the step provided incorrectly states \\( y = -15 \\), which is a miscalculation.\n\nThe correct calculation should yield \\( y = 15 \\), not \\( y = -15 \\).\n\nEvaluation Result: INCORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The step correctly calculates the total number of pizza slices by multiplying the number of pizzas (7) by the number of slices per pizza (8).\n2. The calculation 7 * 8 = 56 is mathematically correct.\n3. This step aligns with the first part of the reference solution, which also calculates the total number of slices.\n4. This step is necessary to determine how many slices each person can have, as it establishes the total amount of pizza to be shared.\n\nThe step is mathematically valid and aligns with the reference solution.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The problem states that Henry and 3 of his friends are sharing the pizzas\n2. To find total people, we need to include Henry plus his 3 friends\n3. The calculation 1 + 3 = 4 is mathematically correct\n4. This matches the reference solution's calculation\n5. This step is necessary to determine how many slices each person will get (by dividing total slices by total people)\n\nThe step demonstrates correct mathematical reasoning and aligns with both the problem statement and the reference solution.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. This step follows logically from the previously verified steps:\n- We know there are 56 total slices (from step 1)\n- We know there are 4 people sharing (from step 2)\n2. The calculation 56 \u00f7 4 = 14 is mathematically correct\n3. This matches the reference solution's approach and final answer\n4. The step is logically sound: to find how many slices each person gets, we divide the total slices by the number of people\n\nThe step demonstrates correct mathematical reasoning and aligns with both the previous steps and the reference solution.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT ",
    "Reasoning:\n1. The step calculates the total value of the sapphires Jenna starts with, assuming all 8 sapphires are still in her possession\n2. The calculation 8 \u00d7 $800 = $6400 is mathematically correct\n3. However, this calculation is incorrect in the context of the problem because it doesn't account for the trade\n4. According to the problem, Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies\n5. Therefore, after the trade, Jenna should have 5 sapphires (8 - 3 = 5)\n6. The value calculation should be based on the 5 sapphires she retains, not the original 8\n\nThe step incorrectly values all 8 sapphires without accounting for the trade, leading to an incorrect total value for Jenna's sapphires.\n\nEvaluation Result: INCORRECT "

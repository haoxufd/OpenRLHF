Calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has at the end of the trading process.\n\nReasoning:\n1. To find the total number of buttons Lorraine has at the end of the trading process, we need to sum up all the different types of buttons she has:\n   - Large buttons: 9 (from step 5)\n   - Small buttons: 60 (from step 6) + 27 (from step 7) = 87\n2. The total number of buttons should be 9 (large buttons) + 87 (small buttons) = 96 buttons\n3. The reference solution claims 89 buttons, which appears to be an error\n4. The calculation 9 + 87 = 96 is mathematically correct\n\nThe step correctly calculates the total number of buttons Lorraine has at the end of the trading process, but the reference solution contains an error in the final total.\n\nEvaluation Result: INCORRECT "

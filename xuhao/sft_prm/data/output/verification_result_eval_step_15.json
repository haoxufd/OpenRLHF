This step follows logically from the previously verified steps:\n- We know there are 56 total slices (from step 1)\n- We know there are 4 people sharing (from step 2)\n2. The calculation 56 \u00f7 4 = 14 is mathematically correct\n3. This matches the reference solution's approach and final answer\n4. The step is logically sound: to find how many slices each person gets, we divide the total slices by the number of people\n\nThe step demonstrates correct mathematical reasoning and aligns with both the previous steps and the reference solution.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT "

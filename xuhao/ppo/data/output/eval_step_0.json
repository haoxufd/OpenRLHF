Multiplying both sides of the equation by 100, we get 100x - x = 450000 jelly beans. Adding x to both sides of the equation, we get 100x = 450001 jelly beans. Dividing both sides by 100, we get x = 4500 jelly beans, which represents the number of blue jelly beans in the jar.\nWe also know that x + (x/100) = 4500 jelly beans. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 100, we get 100x + x = 450000 jelly beans. Combining like terms, we get 101x = 450000 jelly beans. Dividing both sides by 101, we get x = 4450 jelly beans, which represents the number of green jelly beans in the jar.

    "Let S be the number of sheep on Lee's farm and G be the number of geese. We know that S + G = 20 and 2S + G = 70. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get S + G + G = 70. We can then combine like terms to get 2G + S = 70. We can then subtract 1 from both sides to get 2G = 69. We can then divide both sides by 2 to get G = 69/2 = <<69/2=34.5>>34.5. Since G must be an integer, this means there are 35 geese on Lee's farm.\nSubstituting this back into the equation S + G = 20, we get S + 35 = 20.

    "Let o be the number of ounces of oil, s be the number of ounces of salt, z be the number of ounces of zest, and f be the number of ounces of fragrance. We know that o = 2s, s = z, and o + s + z + f = 10. Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get 2s + s + s + f = 10. Combining like terms, we get 4s + f = 10. Substituting s = z, we get 4z + f = 10. Substituting z = f, we get 4f + f = 10. Combining like terms, we get 5f = 10. Dividing both sides by 5, we get f = 2.

    "Let L be the number of large stuffed animals sold and S be the number of small stuffed animals sold. We know that L + S = 2L and 3L + 4S = 120. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 3(2L) + 4S = 120. Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get 6L + 4S = 120. Substituting the equation 2L = L + S into the equation 6L + 4S = 120, we get 6L + 4(L + S) = 120. Distributing 4 to L + S, we get 6L + 4L + 4S = 120. Combining like terms, we get 10L + 4S = 120. Subtracting 4S from both sides, we get 10L = 116. Dividing both sides by 10, we get L = 11. Substituting this value back into the equation 2L = L + S, we get 22 = 11 + S. Subtracting 11 from both sides, we get S = 11. Teresa sold 11 small stuffed animals.\n#### 11<|eot_id|> <|end_of_text|>",

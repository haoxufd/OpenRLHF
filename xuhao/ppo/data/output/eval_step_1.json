    "Let R be the total amount of water in the Colorado River. If Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River, then it uses 40/100 * R = 2R/5 = 40% * R = 40R/100 gallons of water.\nIf 80% of the water used by Colorado City is used for industrial purposes, then 100% - 80% = 20% of the water is used for non-industrial purposes.\nLet N be the amount of water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes. We know that 40R/100 = 5N/4. Multiply both sides of this equation by 4/5 to get 8R/10 = N. Multiply both sides of this equation by 10/8 to get R = 5N/4.\nSubstituting this back into the equation 40R/100 = 5N/4, we get 40 * 5N/4 = 100 * 5N/4 * 4/5 = 5N gallons of water. Dividing both sides by 5, we get 8N/10 = N. Multiply both sides of this equation by 10/8 to get N = 5N/4. Substituting this back into the equation 8N/10 = N, we get 8 * 5N/4 = 10 * N. Dividing both sides by 8, we get 5N/4 = N. Multiply both sides of this equation by 4/5 to get N = N. Therefore, the amount of water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes is N = 40R/100 = 40/100 * 5N/4 = 2N/5 gallons of water.\n#### 2<|eot_id|> <|end_of_text|>",

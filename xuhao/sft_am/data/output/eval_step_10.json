    "First find the total number of eggs laid per day: 16 eggs/day * 7 days/week = <<16*7=112>>112 eggs/week\nThen subtract the number of eggs Janet eats and bakes: 112 eggs/week - 3 eggs/day - 4 eggs/day = <<112-3-4=105>>105 eggs/week\nThen divide the number of eggs by the number of days to find the number of eggs per day: 105 eggs/week / 7 days/week = <<105/7=15>>15 eggs/day\nThen multiply the number of eggs per day by the price per egg to find Janet's daily earnings: 15 eggs/day * $2/egg = $<<15*2=30>>30/day\n#### 30 "

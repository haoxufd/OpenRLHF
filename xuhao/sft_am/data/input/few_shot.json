Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes so she will peel 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 oranges in an hour<|reserved_special_token_0|>Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes so she will peel 60/4 = <<60/4=15>>15 oranges in an hour<|reserved_special_token_0|>Ana will have peeled 20-15 = <<20-15=5>>5 more oranges<|reserved_special_token_0|>#### 5"

        "solution": "Calculate the second dog's food consumption. Second dog's food = 13 pounds Ã— 2 = <<13*2=26>> pounds.<|reserved_special_token_0|>Calculate the total food consumption of the first two dogs. First two dogs' food = 13 pounds + 26 pounds = <<13+26=39>> pounds.<|reserved_special_token_0|>Calculate the third dog's food consumption. Third dog's food = Total food - First two dogs' food = 15 pounds - 39 pounds = <<15-9=-24>> pounds.<|reserved_special_token_0|>Since a dog cannot eat a negative amount of food, the given information is inconsistent.<|reserved_special_token_0|>#### None"

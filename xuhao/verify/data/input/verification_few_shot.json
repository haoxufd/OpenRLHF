        "input": "Problem:\nEvery day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy. She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed. How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?\n\nReference Solution:\nIf each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20 < 3*20=60 > 60 cups of feed per day.\nIf she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25 < 60-15-25=20 > 20 cups of chicken feed.\n#### 20\n\nPrevious Steps:\n1. Wendi feeds each of her 20 chickens 3 cups of feed per day, so the total cups of feed needed per day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups.\n2. In the morning and afternoon, Wendi gives her chickens 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed.\n\nStep to Evaluate:\nTo find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, we subtract the feed already given from the total cups of feed needed per day: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.",
        "output": "Reasoning:\n1. This step follows logically from the previously verified steps:\n- We know the total daily requirement is 60 cups (from step 1)\n- We know 40 cups have been given in morning and afternoon (from step 2)\n2. The calculation 60 - 40 = 20 is mathematically correct\n3. This matches the reference solution's approach and final answer\n4. The step is logically sound: to find the remaining feed needed, we subtract what's already been given from the total requirement\n\nThe step demonstrates correct mathematical reasoning and aligns with both the previous steps and the reference solution.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT"

        "input": "Problem:\nTobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?\n\nReference Solution:\nHe saved up $110 total because 95 + 15 = <<95+15=110>>110\nHe saved $15 from his allowance because 3 x 5 = <<35=15>>15\nHe earned $60 mowing lawns because 4 x 15 = <<415=60>>60\nHe earned $35 shoveling driveways because 110 - 60 - 15 = <<110-60-15=35>>35\nHe shoveled 5 driveways because 35 / 7 = <<35/7=5>>5\n#### 5\n\nPrevious Steps:\n1. Calculate total allowance earned in three months. Allowance per month = $5, total allowance = 3 months \u00d7 $5 = <35=15> dollars.\n2. Calculate total earnings from mowing lawns. Earnings per lawn = $15, total earnings from lawns = 4 lawns \u00d7 $15 = <415=60> dollars.\n3. Calculate total earnings from shoveling driveways. Total earnings = $95 (shoes) + $15 (change) - $15 (allowance) - $60 (lawns) = <95+15-15-60=35> dollars.\n\nStep to Evaluate:\n4. Calculate earnings from shoveling driveways. Earnings from shoveling = Total earnings - Allowance - Earnings from lawns = $35 - $15 - $60 = <35-15-60=-40> dollars.",
        "output": "Reasoning:\n1. The calculation is redundant since step 3 already calculated the total earnings from shoveling driveways as $35\n2. The calculation itself is incorrect both mathematically and logically:\n- It uses $35 as the total earnings when $35 is actually the already calculated earnings from shoveling\n- The arithmetic $35 - $15 - $60 = -40 would give a negative amount, which doesn't make sense in this context\n- It's double-subtracting the allowance and lawn earnings which were already accounted for in step 3\n\nFrom the previous verified steps, we already know that earnings from shoveling driveways is $35. The next step should be to determine how many driveways were shoveled, not recalculate the earnings.\n\nEvaluation Result: INCORRECT"

        "input": "Problem:\nThe profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?\n\nReference Solution:\nAccording to the ratio, for every 5 parts that Johnson gets, Mike gets 2 parts\nSince Johnson got $2500, each part is therefore $2500/5 = $<<2500/5=500>>500\nMike will get 2$500 = $<<2500=1000>>1000\nAfter buying the shirt he will have $1000-$200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800 left\n#### 800\n\nPrevious Steps:\n\n\nStep to Evaluate:\n1. Calculate the total parts in the ratio. Total parts = 2 + 5 = 7 parts.",
        "output": "Reasoning:\n1. The ratio given is 2:5 (Mike:Johnson)\n2. To find total parts in a ratio, we add the numbers in the ratio\n3. The calculation 2 + 5 = 7 is mathematically correct\n4. While the reference solution uses a different approach (finding the value of one part using Johnson's share), calculating total parts is still mathematically valid and could lead to a correct solution\n5. This step establishes a valid foundation for solving ratio problems, even though it takes a different path than the reference solution\n\nThe step demonstrates correct mathematical understanding of how to calculate total parts in a ratio.\n\nEvaluation Result: CORRECT"

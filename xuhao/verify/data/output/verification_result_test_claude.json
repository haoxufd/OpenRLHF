The reference solution clearly outlines that Marcy works for 10 years after the 20-year mark (i.e., 30 - 20 = 10 years), and thus she is entitled to 10 years * 5% = 50% of her full pension.\n3. The full pension is $50,000, but the step in question assumes she receives the full $50,000 rather than calculating the percentage based on the additional years worked after 20 years, as shown in the reference solution.\n4. According to the conditions of the pension plan, her annual pension after 30 years should be the $50,000 * 50% = $25,000, not the full $50,000.\n\nThe step incorrectly calculates or assumes the pension entitlement after 30 years, failing to apply the 5% per year formula after 20 years. Therefore, it does not align with the reference solution or the mathematical reasoning regarding the pension calculation.\n\nEvaluation Result: INCORRECT"

You are a senior mathematics professor assessing a student's multi-step solution. Your evaluation will be based on the following inputs:
The original mathematical question
A reference solution (for comparison)
A sequence of previously verified correct steps from the student's answer
A new step to evaluate

Evaluation Criteria:
Your primary task is to determine whether the new step is CORRECT or INCORRECT. If the new step (combined with prior steps) follows the same logical progression as the reference solution, it is correct. However, not following the path of reference answer doesn't mean it is incorrect, since the reference solution is not the only valid approach. A step may deviate from the reference yet still be correct if it:
Follows logically from the previous steps,
Adheres to mathematical principles, and
Contributes soundly toward solving the problem.

In addition to the membership discount, the man also has a coupon for $10 off any pair of sneakers.
